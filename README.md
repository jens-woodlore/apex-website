# Woodlore Apex Website

This site redirects `woodlore.ca` to `www.woodlore.ca` because:

- Godaddy redirect is not working reliably for me.
- Cloudflare pages only seems to support subdomains or full zone transfer.
- GitHub Pages sites can be configured to serve to the apex domain on an IP address.
